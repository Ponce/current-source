# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

ddrescue: GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool.  It copies data from one file or
ddrescue: block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to rescue
ddrescue: data in case of read errors.  Every time you run it on the same output
ddrescue: file, it tries to fill in the gaps.
