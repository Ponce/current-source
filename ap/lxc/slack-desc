# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

lxc:
lxc: Linux Containers (LXC) are an operating system-level virtualization
lxc: method for running multiple isolated server installs (containers) on
lxc: a single control host.  LXC does not provide a virtual machine, but
lxc: rather provides a virtual environment that has its own process and
lxc: network space.  It is similar to a chroot, but offers more isolation.
