# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

ash: ash (Kenneth Almquist's ash shell)
ash:
ash: A lightweight (92K) Bourne compatible shell.  Great for machines with
ash: low memory, but does not provide all the extras of shells like bash,
ash: tcsh, and zsh.  Runs most shell scripts compatible with the Bourne
ash: shell.  Note that under Linux, most scripts seem to use at least some
ash: bash-specific syntax.  The Slackware setup scripts are a notable
ash: exception, since ash is the shell used on the install disks.  NetBSD
ash: uses ash as its /bin/sh.
