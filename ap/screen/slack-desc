# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

screen: and several control functions from the ISO 6492 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64)
screen: and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for
screen: multiple character sets).  There is a scrollback history buffer for
screen: each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows
screen: moving text regions between windows.
