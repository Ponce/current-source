# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

xfsdump:
xfsdump: The xfsdump package contains the xfsdump and xfsrestore utilities for
xfsdump: backing up and restoring XFS partitions.  xfsdump examines files in a
xfsdump: filesystem, determines which need to be backed up, and copies those
xfsdump: files to a specified disk, tape or other storage medium.  xfsrestore
xfsdump: performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a full
xfsdump: or incremental backup of a filesystem.
