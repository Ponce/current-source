# --with-x or not --with-x, that is the question.  It seems many other
# distributions don't compile with X support, but it's been traditional
# here.  I am moving the prefix to /usr (instead of /usr/X11R6) though,
# because many X-linked things are put into /usr now (like GNOME), and
# I've heard a few reports of compile failures when this isn't in /usr.
# Everyone else does it -- time to follow the path of least resistance.
