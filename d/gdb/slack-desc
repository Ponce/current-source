# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

gdb: gdb (the GNU symbolic debugger)
gdb: GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on 
gdb: inside another program while it executes -- or what another program
gdb: was doing at the moment it crashed.  GDB can do four main kinds of
gdb: things to help you catch bugs in the act:   1) Start your program,
gdb: specifying anything that might affect its behavior.  2) Make your
gdb: program stop on specified conditions.  3) Examine what has happened,
gdb: when your program has stopped.  4) Change things in your program, so
gdb: you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on
gdb: to learn about another.  The program being debugged can be written in
gdb: Ada, C, C++, Objective-C, Pascal and many other languages.
