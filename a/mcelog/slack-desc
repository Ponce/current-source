# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

mcelog: mcelog (Machine Check Event logger)
mcelog:
mcelog: mcelog is the user space backend for logging machine check errors
mcelog: reported by the hardware to the kernel.  The kernel does the immediate
mcelog: actions (like killing processes etc.) and mcelog decodes the logs the
mcelog: errors.  It primarily handles machine checks and thermal events, which
mcelog: are reported for errors detected by the CPU.  It is recommended that
mcelog: mcelog runs on all x86 machines, both 64-bit and 32bit.
