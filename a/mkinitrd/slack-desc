# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

mkinitrd: the same time as the kernel.  The initial ramdisk may be responsible
mkinitrd: for loading kernel modules (such a filesystem or SCSI controller
mkinitrd: module) that are needed to mount the root filesystem.
mkinitrd:
mkinitrd: The "initrd" is implemented as an initramfs.  See the kernel
