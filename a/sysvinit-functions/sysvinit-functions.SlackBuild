# them, but since some commerical software makes the assuption
# that /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions will exist (and uses it),
# shipping at least it and the sysvinit runlevel directories
# will probably make life easier for everybody.  We'll maybe
# ever consider splitting a few of the functions of the old
# venerable BSD-style init scripts into runlevel scripts (if
# it looks like it will make system maintainance easier).
