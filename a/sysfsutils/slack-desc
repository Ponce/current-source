# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

sysfsutils: The purpose of this package is to provide a set of utilities for
sysfsutils: interfacing with sysfs, a virtual filesystem in Linux kernel versions
sysfsutils: 2.6+ that provides a tree of system devices.  While a filesystem is a
sysfsutils: very useful interface, a library (libsysfs) is also included that
sysfsutils: will hopefully make it easier for applications to query system
sysfsutils: devices and their attributes.
