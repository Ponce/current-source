# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

mt-st: This mt originates from BSD NET-2.  Some Linux SCSI tape-specific
mt-st: ioctls have been added to the original source and the man page has
mt-st: been updated.  Although this mt program is tailored for SCSI tape, it
mt-st: can also be used with the QIC-02 driver and hopefully with other Linux
mt-st: tape drivers using the same ioctls (some of the commands may not work
mt-st: with all drivers).
