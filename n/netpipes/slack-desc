# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

netpipes: Robert Forsman's netpipes package makes TCP/IP streams usable in shell
netpipes: scripts.  It can also simplify client/server code by allowing the 
netpipes: programmer to skip all the tedious programming bits related to sockets
netpipes: and concentrate on writing a filter/service.  Here's an example of
netpipes: what you can do with 'faucet' and 'hose', two netpipes commands:
netpipes: 
netpipes: server$ faucet 3000 -out tar cf - .
netpipes: client$ hose server 3000 -in tar xvf -
