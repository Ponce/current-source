# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

netdate: netdate (simple network time utility)
netdate:
netdate: Netdate takes a list of names of Internet hosts as arguments, selects
netdate: the one which supplies the best time, and sets the system time
netdate: accordingly.  The invoker must be the super-user for the time to be
netdate: set.  Protocol names (either udp or tcp) may be interspersed with the
netdate: host names, and determine the protocol which will be used to connect
netdate: to the hosts whose names follow, up to the next protocol name or the
netdate: end of the arguments.  The default protocol is udp.

netdate: These days, "ntpdate" is probably a better choice.
