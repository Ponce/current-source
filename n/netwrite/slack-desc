# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

netwrite: netwrite (in.writed daemon for accepting network "write")
netwrite:
netwrite: Writed implements a very simple protocol that allows a write(1)
netwrite: program on one host to connect up to one on another host, allowing
netwrite: communications across the network.  Writed is meant to be run from
netwrite: inetd(8) listening for TCP requests on port 811.  No attempt is made
netwrite: to determine the authenticity of users sending messages.  This
netwrite: program should probably not be deployed on insecure networks.
