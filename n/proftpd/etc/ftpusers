# ftpusers	This file describes the names of the users that may
#		_*NOT*_ log into the system via the FTP server.
#		This usually includes "root", "uucp", "news" and the
#		like, because those users have too much power to be
#		allowed to do "just" FTP...

# The entire line gets matched, so no comments or extra characters on

# To enable anonymous FTP, remove the "ftp" user:

root
uucp
news

# End of ftpusers.
