# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

dirmngr: CRL (Certificate Revocation Lists Manager)
dirmngr:
dirmngr: Dirmngr is a server for managing and downloading certificate
dirmngr: revocation lists (CRLs) for X.509 certificates and for downloading
dirmngr: the certificates themselves.  Dirmngr also handles OCSP requests as
dirmngr: an alternative to CRLs.  Dirmngr is either invoked internally by
dirmngr: gpgsm (from gnupg 2.x) or when running as a system daemon through
dirmngr: the dirmngr-client tool.
