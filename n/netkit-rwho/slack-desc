# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

netkit-rwho: The rwho command produces output similar to who, but for all machines
netkit-rwho: on the local network.  If no report has been received from a machine
netkit-rwho: for 11 minutes then rwho assumes the machine is down, and does not
netkit-rwho: report users last known to be logged into that machine.  If a users
netkit-rwho: hasn't typed to the system for a minute or more, then rwho reports
netkit-rwho: this idle time.  If a user hasn't typed to the system for an hour or
netkit-rwho: more, then the user will be omitted from the output of rwho unless
netkit-rwho: the -a flag is given.
