# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

hal: piece of hardware and provides hooks so that system and desktop
hal: software can react to changes in the hardware configuration (such as
hal: the insertion of a DVD, or a USB flash memory stick).
