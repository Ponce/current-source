# ChangeLog:
# 2008-03-10:   Updated timezones from tzdata2008a. <pjv>
# 2007-12-21:   Updated timezones from tzdata2007j. <pjv>
# 2006-12-03:   Updated timezones from tzdata2006p. <pjv>
# 2006-09-14:   Updated timezones from tzdata2006k. <pjv>
# 2006-08-22:   Updated timezones from tzdata2006j.
# 2006-08-13:   Updated timezones from tzdata2006g.
# 2006-03-13:   Updated timezones from tzdata2006c.
# 19-Feb-2001   Add new timezones from glibc-2.2.2.
# 06-Oct-2000   Fixed a problem with selecting UTC time.  It was writing
#               the hardwareclock file to the root disk and not your dest
#               partition.  Changed the HWCLOCK_CONF variable to be
#               $T_PX/etc/hardwareclock to fix this.  Thanks to David L.
#               Dickman <softbear@optonline.net> for finding this and
#               submitting a patch.
#
# 15-Mar-2000   Added the writeconf function to write out the
#               /etc/hardwareclock file which tells what the hardware clock
#               is set to (UTC or localtime).
#
# 03-Mar-2000   Reorganized script.  Made one timezone set block, added
#               stage that asks the user if the hardware clock is set to
#               UTC.
