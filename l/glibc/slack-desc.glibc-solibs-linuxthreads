# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

glibc-solibs-linuxthreads: glibc-solibs-linuxthreads (LinuxThreads shared GNU C libraries)
glibc-solibs-linuxthreads:
glibc-solibs-linuxthreads: This package contains the shared libraries for glibc that uses
glibc-solibs-linuxthreads: LinuxThreads, the threading implementation in Linux 2.4.x and
glibc-solibs-linuxthreads: earlier kernels.  In some cases you'll need to use these libraries
glibc-solibs-linuxthreads: to run old binaries by setting these environment variables:
glibc-solibs-linuxthreads:   export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.4.33
glibc-solibs-linuxthreads:   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib/obsolete/linuxthreads
glibc-solibs-linuxthreads:   old-program
glibc-solibs-linuxthreads: Most users should have no need for this package.  Recompile.  :-)
