# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

mm: OSSP mm is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies the usage of
mm: shared memory between forked processes.  On the first layer it hides
mm: all platform dependent implementation details (allocation and locking)
mm: when dealing with shared memory segments and on the second layer it
mm: provides a high-level malloc(3)-style API to work with data inside
mm: those shared memory segments.  Apache, PHP, and other projects use mm.
