# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

fftw: fftw (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West)
fftw: 
fftw: FFTW is a free collection of fast C routines for computing the
fftw: Discrete Fourier Transform in one or more dimensions.  It includes
fftw: complex, real, symmetric, and parallel transforms, and can handle
fftw: arbitrary array sizes efficiently.  FFTW is typically faster than
fftw: other publically-available FFT implementations, and is even
fftw: competitive with vendor-tuned libraries.
