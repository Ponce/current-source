# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libelf: Libelf lets you read, modify or create ELF files in an architecture
libelf: independent way.  The library takes care of size and endian issues,
libelf: so for example you can process a file for SPARC processors on an
libelf: Intel based system.  GCC uses libelf for LTO (Link Time Optimization).
