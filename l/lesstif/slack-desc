# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

lesstif:
lesstif: LessTif is the Hungry Programmers' (www.hungry.com) free clone of
lesstif: Motif(R). It aims to be source compatible with OSF/Motif(R) meaning
lesstif: that the same source code should compile with both and work exactly
lesstif: the same.  This package contains the libraries and header files to
lesstif: be able to run and compile Motif applications, along with the lesstif
lesstif: version of mwm, the Motif window manager.
