# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libaio:
libaio: The Linux-native asynchronous I/O facility ("async I/O", or "aio")
libaio: has a richer API and capability set than the simple POSIX async I/O
libaio: facility.  This library provides the Linux-native API for async I/O.
libaio: The POSIX async I/O facility requires this library in order to
libaio: provide kernel-accelerated async I/O capabilities, as do applications
libaio: which require the Linux-native async I/O API.
