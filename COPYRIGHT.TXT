
This is the Slackware COPYRIGHT file.  This file provides documentation
about many of the licenses used by components included in Slackware, as
well as some acknowledgements (some required, some freely given).

This is not meant to be a list of all copyrights and contributors.
For complete information about all copyrights and licenses, refer to

The Linux(R) kernel is licensed under the GPL version 2, which can
be found in the file COPYING.  Linus offers his interpretation of how
the GPL applies to the kernel at the top of the COPYING file found in
the kernel sources.  Here's the quote:

  "NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
 services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
 of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
 Also note that the GPL below is copyrighted by the Free Software
 Foundation, but the instance of code that it refers to (the Linux
 kernel) is copyrighted by me and others who actually wrote it.

 Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel
 is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
 v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.

                        Linus Torvalds"

Slackware is a registered trademark of Patrick Volkerding and Slackware Linux, Inc.
Permission to use the Slackware trademark to refer to the Slackware distribution
of Linux is hereby granted if the following conditions are met:

1.  In order to be called "Slackware", the distribution may not be altered
    from the way it appears on the central FTP site (ftp.slackware.com).  This
    is to protect the integrity, reliability, and reputation of the Slackware
    distribution.  (Note that moving entire directories like "source" or
    "contrib" to a second CD-ROM is allowable, but leaving them out and 
    distributing a single source-free disc is *not*, as indicated below)
    Anyone wishing to distribute an altered version must have the changes
    approved by volkerdi@slackware.com (i.e. certified to be reasonably
    bug-free).  If the changed distribution meets the required standards for
    quality, then written permission to use the Slackware trademark may be
    provided.

2.  All related source code must be included.  (This is also required by the
    GNU General Public License, and other licenses)

3.  Except by written permission from Slackware Linux, Inc., the Slackware
    trademark may not be used as (or as part of) a product name, company
    name, or registered domain name.

4.  Any approved use of "Slackware" must be followed by a circle-R, and must
    acknowledge our ownership of the mark.

Note that you can still redistribute a distribution that doesn't meet these
criteria, you just can't call it "Slackware".  Personally, I hate restricting
things in any way, but these restrictions are not designed to make life
difficult for anyone.  I just want to make sure that bugs are not added to
commercial redistributions of Slackware.  They have been in the past, and
the resulting requests for help have flooded my mailbox!  I'm just trying to
make sure that I have some recourse when something like that happens.

Any questions about this policy should be directed to:

Although every effort has been made to provide a complete source tree for this
project, it's possible that something may have been forgotten.  If you discover
anything is missing, we will provide copies - just ask!

NOTE: We are required to provide any missing source to GPLv2'ed software for
3 years, per this section of the GNU General Public License:

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

We are also required to do the above, or provide access to copy the source that
corresponds to your binaries from a network server in the case of materials
which are licensed under the GPLv3 (see COPYING3 for the complete license).

If you find something is missing online (even if you don't need a copy),
please point it out to volkerdi@slackware.com so it can be fixed.

If some source code falling under this or a similar license is missing from
a commercial Slackware release obtained from or manufactured by us, and you
want a copy, just ask volkerdi@slackware.com and we will be happy to arrange
for you to get a copy in compliance with the terms of the specific license.
