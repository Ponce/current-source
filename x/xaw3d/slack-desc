# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

xaw3d: xaw3d (3D version of libXaw)
xaw3d:
xaw3d: Xaw3d is a set of 3D widgets by Kaleb S. Keithley based on the Athena
xaw3d: Widget set.  The Three-D Athena may be used as a replacement for the
xaw3d: Athena (Xaw) Widget set -- you may relink almost any Athena Widget
xaw3d: based application and obtain a three dimensional appearance on some of
xaw3d: the widgets.  You can also replace your shared libXaw with libXaw3d
xaw3d: and obtain the three dimensional appearance without even relinking.
