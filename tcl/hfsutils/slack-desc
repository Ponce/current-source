# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

hfsutils: hfsutils (HFS volume utilities)
hfsutils:
hfsutils: hfsutils is a collection of tools for reading and writing Macintosh
hfsutils: HFS volumes.  These utilities can manipulate HFS volumes on nearly any
hfsutils: medium.  Since hfs and xhfs are linked with Tcl/Tk shared libraries,
hfsutils: the hfsutils package is included here in the TCL software series.
